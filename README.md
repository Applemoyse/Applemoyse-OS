This hub serves as a digital manifestation of my coding journey, featuring information about me, Luna (my beloved white cat), the projects I've created, and even a good ol' chatbox to connect with fellow enthusiasts.
It is named after the concept of a desktop environment (DE), it boasts a sleek and intuitive design that mimics the familiarity of a desktop experience. It's simple, straightforward, and designed to provide a nice browsing experience.

You can see it live [here](https://applemoyse-os.vercel.app).
Feel free to navigate through the various sections, get to know me and Luna, check out my projects, and even strike up a conversation through the chatbox.

Hope you will enjoy the visit!
